### I am on the latest system version, is my device hackable?
Yes, 3.73 is hackable at the moment.

### Can I downgrade my Vita?
Yes, the tool Modoru can downgrade any system hacked with HENkaku or h-encore to any firmware equal or greater than the firmware the console came with out of the box.

### Is it safe to update a Vita with CFW?
There is no need to update a PSVita with CFW. Stay on 3.60 or 3.65.

### How risky is hacking my console?
Bricks are *basically* impossible unless you ignore instructions and Sony doesn't ban consoles nor accounts unless you hack trophies or in-game.

### Can I run awesome homebrew and emulators with this?
Yes! This enables any custom user-made homebrew to be played on your device.

### Where should I go for support?
For support, ask for help at [Official Henkaku Discord](https://discord.gg/m7MwpKA).

### Can I do this without a computer?
You must have a computer if you are on firmware version 3.61 or higher.
