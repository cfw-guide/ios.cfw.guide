title: "Installing Ensō"

### Required Reading

Ensō is a complete CFW solution for the PS Vita (TV) which allows for convenient homebrew access on your device by running an exploit at boot-time to setup the HENkaku homebrew environment.

It is more convenient than HENkaku as it does not require you to trigger an exploit on your device after every reboot manually.

In this guide, we'll be using VitaDeploy to install both HENkaku Ensō and firmware version 3.65. If you want to install it manually, follow [Installing Ensō (3.60)](installing-enso-(3.60)) or [Installing Ensō (3.65)](installing-enso-(3.65)).
