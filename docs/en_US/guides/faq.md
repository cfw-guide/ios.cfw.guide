## What is jailbreaking?

Jailbreaking is a term used to describe the process that allows you to truly unlock the potential of your iOS device. Apple's mobile operating system is known for its security and that's partly because of how locked-down it is. Jailbreaking your device will allow you to break those restrictions and customize your device to how you like it.

Jailbreaking gives you the ability to install custom applications and "tweaks" (modifications) from a package manager to customize and enhance the user experience. Jailbreaking is free and easy on most devices.

## Is jailbreaking legal?

Jailbreaking in the US is perfectly legal. In 2010, the US Copyright Office declared jailbreaking to be an exception to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

You may want to check in your country whether it is legal there or not before proceeding, however in most countries it should be fine.

## What is a package manager?

Package managers are used to install, uninstall and modify official or community-made software to customize your device. Sileo is an example of a package manager.

They can be considered similar to the iOS App Store, where you can install both free and paid software.

## What's a repo?

These are essentially databases that contain lots of tweaks for you to install. When you add repos to your package manager, you will be able to install the tweaks contained on it, and look for them using the search function.

## What are tweaks?

Tweaks are small modifications that can be installed change the look and/or feel of your device.

Unlike apps, tweaks usually don't come with an app icon, but rather instead an area in the Settings app to change how the tweak acts. Some simpler tweaks might not even have this.

## What is "respringing" or "Restarting Springboard"?

Respringing is essentially restarting the home screen and the iOS UI. Most of the time, you can install a tweak and respring to apply it, without fully rebooting.

You won't have to reinstall an exploit after respringing, however, and you can remain jailbroken.

## What is Recovery Mode?

Recovery Mode is a protection built-in to your device that allows the user to completely start over with a fresh install of iOS. This is especially useful if the installed OS is damaged and cannot start properly, which can happen during jailbreaks, although rare. Entering recovery mode can be done on device and through a computer, and iTunes/Finder utilise recovery mode during normal upgrades and restores.

## What is DFU mode?

DFU mode is a way you can interact with your iOS device without loading the operating system or boot loader. It stands for Device Firmware Upgrade. It's functionally different from recovery mode and is generally intended as a last resort in case things seriously go wrong on your device, however we can use it with <router-link to="/installing-odysseyra1n">Odysseyra1n</router-link> to jailbreak your device instead. Entering DFU mode can only be done on device as it is part of the phone itself.

## What can I do once jailbroken?

- Gain full access to your device's OS
- Get access to a package manager, such as Sileo
- Install themes to change the look and feel of your device
- Install tweaks to change how iOS behaves

## What should I know before starting?

::: danger

Before following the steps of this guide, you must know the risks of jailbreaking: Every time you modify your system in any way, there is always a chance that you could lose user data and ability to jailbreak. It is, however, very rare for a system to be rendered completely unrecoverable.

:::

- It is **strongly** recommended to backup your device to iCloud, iTunes, or Finder (on macOS Catalina or newer) in case of data loss
- If no issues occur during installation, you will be jailbroken without any data loss
- Keep the device plugged into to a power source or keep the battery fairly charged, so that any unexpected power off can be prevented
- Jailbreaking allows you to unlock your system but can lead to data loss if you damage the OS
- You may be vulnerable to more malware and other security issues after jailbreaking compared to if you were in a non-jailbroken state
- Your device warranty will become void after jailbreaking until it is restored to an un-jailbroken state, which is easy to do

## Should I use tweaks such as Batchomatic or IAmLazy

You should **not** use these tweaks, due to the fact that they tend to cause issues and instability within your jailbreaking setup.
