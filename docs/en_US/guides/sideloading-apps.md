## Required Reading

Semi-untethered jailbreaks require the use of a sideloaded app to jailbreak. Apps sideloaded with a regular Apple ID will expire after 7 days (or 365 days with a Developer Apple ID). After that period, you will no longer be able to open that app to re-jailbreak.

::: danger

If you are using iOS 16 or newer, you will need to take extra steps beforehand to open sideloaded apps:

1. Open Settings
1. Go to Privacy & Security and find the `Developer Mode` entry
1. Toggle Developer Mode on, then press `Reboot`
1. After the device reboots, unlock it, and confirm that you want to enable Developer Mode
  - If you have a passcode enabled, you'll need to enter it.

## Sideloading apps

### Sideload using Sideloadly

::: tip

Sideloadly is compatible with iOS 7 and newer.
