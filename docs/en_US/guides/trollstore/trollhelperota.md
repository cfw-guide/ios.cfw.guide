## Installing TrollHelper

1. Tap `Install`

An app named `GTA Car Tracker` will now install to your iOS device, though this is really just the TrollHelperOTA app.

## Installing TrollStore

1. Open the `GTA Car Tracker` app on your home screen
1. Press `Register Persistence Helper`
1. Press `Install TrollStore`
    - If your device reboots, redo these steps

TrollStore should now be installed. If it doesn't appear on the home screen, restart your device.
