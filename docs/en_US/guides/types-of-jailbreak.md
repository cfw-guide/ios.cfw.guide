Not all jailbreaks work in the same way. This page will take you through each type of jailbreak and explain how they work.

## What are the different types?

There are 4 main types of jailbreaks:

- Fully Untethered
- Semi-Untethered
- Semi-Tethered
- Tethered

Each type is determined by how independent it is from a computer.

### Untethered Jailbreaks
---

Untethered jailbreaks can be considered the holy grail of all jailbreaks. They only require the exploit to be ran once either via a website, an app or a computer.

After that, your device is fully jailbroken and won't require any further action. The exploit will stay on a device even after you reboot it.

Unfortunately, there hasn't been a new untethered jailbreak in a very long time, and it's likely we won't see one for even longer.

The only downside to an untethered jailbreak is that if something goes wrong, it could very well result in a bootloop requiring you to restore your device via iTunes or Finder (macOS Catalina or newer). The likelihood of this happening is _low_, but is indeed possible.

A few examples of untethered jailbreaks are [p0sixspwn](installing-p0sixspwn) and Pangu9.

### Semi-Untethered Jailbreaks
---

Semi-untethered jailbreaks have been the most popular type of jailbreak in recent years. This type of jailbreak requires an exploit to be executed every time you reboot or turn off your device.

This jailbreak works by running the exploit through an app on the device itself. The app, however, must be resigned every 7 days if sideloaded with a standard Apple ID. Utilities like AltStore, ReProvision Reborn, and AltDaemon make this process far easier.

Due to the nature of how the exploit is applied, these jailbreaks are easily removable through their respective app.

A few examples of semi-untethered jailbreaks include [Taurine](installing-taurine), [unc0ver](installing-unc0ver), and [Odyssey](installing-odyssey).

### Semi-Tethered Jailbreaks
---

Semi-tethered jailbreaks are very similar to semi-untethered jailbreaks, however the exploit must be ran using a computer rather than using a sideloaded app.

Due to requiring a computer to rejailbreak after every reboot, most choose to use a semi-untethered jailbreak instead.

An example of a semi-tethered jailbreak is [Odysseyra1n](installing-odysseyra1n).

### Tethered Jailbreaks
---

Tethered jailbreaks are not meant to be used by the general public. These exploits modify the device in a way that it requires a PC to even boot at all, even without a jailbreak.

Because of this, these tend to only be used by jailbreak developers getting ready for a newer version of iOS.
