Socket is capable of jailbreaking every 32-bit iOS device on firmware version 10.0.1 up to 10.3.4.

Note that the Socket jailbreak is not “persistent” (meaning it does not remain installed after a reboot). You will need to re-run the exploit after every reboot. You will be instructed on how to do this.

Due to how custom applications are installed to the device, in most cases you will need to reinstall the Socket jailbreak application to your device every 7 days from your computer.

We will use Sideloadly to install the application to your device.

## Installing the application

::: warning

If your device crashes or restarts unexpectedly and the jailbreak isn't installed, simply try running the exploit again until it does work.
