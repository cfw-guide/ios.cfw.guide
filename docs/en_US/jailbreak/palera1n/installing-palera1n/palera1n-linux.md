::: danger

If you are trying to use a Virtual Machine software of some sort from Windows (e.g. Virtualbox, VMWare, Windows Subsystem for Linux, etc) you will not succeed with following this guide.

:::

::: warning

If you are using a computer with an AMD Ryzen CPU, you will likely run into issues. If you do run into issues, you should use a Mac or a computer with an Intel CPU to follow this guide.

## Installing the jailbreak

::: warning

Due to issues with Linux, you'll need to do extra steps in order to proceed.

First, open up a terminal, and run these commands:

`sudo systemctl stop usbmuxd`

`sudo usbmuxd -f -p`

Then, open a second terminal, and do the subsequent steps with the other terminal window.

:::

::: tip

If you previously used rootless palera1n or jailbroke with tweaks before November 13th, 2022, run `rm -rf palera1n` before proceeding

:::

1. Clone the repo with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/palera1n/palera1n && cd palera1n`
    - If you've already cloned the repo, just run `cd palera1n`
1. Run `sudo ./palera1n.sh --tweaks <iOS version you're on> --semi-tethered`
    - Put your device in DFU Mode before running this command
    - The semi-tethered flag uses 5-10GB of storage and is also incompatible with 16GB devices, **don't include --semi-tethered in the command** if you are using a 16GB device or have less than 10GB free.
    - If you have a wifi-only device, add the `--no-baseband` switch to the command.
    - If you have an iPhone 7 or iPhone 8, **don't include --semi-tethered in the command**, even if you meet the aforementioned criteria to use the flag.

Your device will then boot into a ramdisk, which will replace the Tips app and dump blobs. It will also set boot args and other variables, and either get ready for the tether or setup the fake rootfs. It will also patch the kernel for you, so you can use tweaks.

1. Once back in recovery/normal mode, place the device into DFU again
1. The device will boot, open the Tips app, and hit install
1. Sileo should have appeared on your homescreen
    - If not, click Tools and choose Do all

Once palera1n says done, tweaks should now be functional. You can find a list of compatible tweaks [here](https://github.com/itsnebulalol/ios15-tweaks).
