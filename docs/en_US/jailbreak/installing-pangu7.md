Pangu7 is capable of jailbreaking every iOS device on firmware version 7.1 up to 7.1.2.

Pangu7 is an untethered jailbreak, meaning that it persists after reboot, so once it's installed you will not have to reinstall it unless you erase your device.

You will need a computer running Windows XP and newer or a Mac running Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks to macOS 10.14 Mojave and the appropriate Pangu.

::: warning

If you are using a 32-bit device, it is recommended to follow <router-link to="/using-lyncis">Using Lyncis</router-link> instead, as it does not require a computer and is substantially easier.
