If you are using a computer with an AMD Ryzen CPU, you will likely run into issues. If you do run into issues, you should use a Mac or a computer with an Intel CPU to follow this guide.

If you are using a USB-C to Lightning cable to do this process, you may run into issues entering into DFU mode

If you do have issues, get a USB-A to Lightning cable and, if necessary, also get a USB-C to USB-A adapter.

## Downloads (ChromeOS)

- The latest release of [palera1n](https://github.com/palera1n/palera1n/releases/latest)

## Allowing palera1n to run

1. Move the palera1n binary which is downloaded to `/usr/local/bin`
    - This can be done by doing the following:
      - press `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T`
      - run `shell`
      - run `mv ~/Downloads/palera1n-linux-* /usr/local/bin/`
1. Run the following command in terminal: `sudo mount -o remount,exec /tmp`
    - You'll need to do this every single time you reboot your ChromeOS device
1. Every time you need to jailbreak in ChromeOS, you need to plug in your device, and enter Recovery Mode manually.

## Running palera1n

1. Run the `palera1n` binary in the terminal using `TERM=linux sudo palera1n`
    - You may need to run `sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/palera1n` if the binary doesn't run
2. You will now need to manually put your device into <router-link to="/faq/#what-is-dfu-mode">DFU mode</router-link>. You can usually find how to do this with a quick Google search.
3. After this, palera1n should automatically detect your device in DFU mode and ask you to press Enter.
4. Once your device shows the Apple logo, immediately unplug and replug your device for your Chromebook to detect the PongoOS USB device.
