Def1nit3lyN0tAJa1lbr3akTool is a <router-link to="/types-of-jailbreak/#semi-untethered-jailbreaks">semi-untethered jailbreak</router-link>, meaning it requires an app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot.

While this tool is capable of jailbreaking A11 and earlier devices on iOS/iPadOS versions 16.0 to 16.5, this tool requires the use of TrollStore, which is currently not installable without a previously existing jailbreak on 16.2 to 16.5.
