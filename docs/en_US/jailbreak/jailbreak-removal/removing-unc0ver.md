Uninstalling a jailbreak isn't as simple as deleting the app. When you uninstall unc0ver, you need to go in the app and restore parts of the OS to how they were before your device was jailbroken.

This guide is useful for people who want to install regular checkra1n, Odysseyra1n, Electra, Chimera, Odyssey, or Taurine as it requires that unc0ver is removed first, or just people who want to unjailbreak their device.

## Uninstalling

1. Open the unc0ver application
1. Tap on the settings icon in the top right-hand corner
1. Uncheck all the options
1. Enable `Restore RootFS`
1. Press `Done` in the top right-hand corner
1. Go to the jailbreak tab and press `Restore RootFS`
    - If the button says `Jailbreak`, go back and check to see if `Restore RootFS` is the only option enabled
1. When prompted about restoring, tap `OK`
    - This may take some time
    - If it fails, try again from the beginning
1. When finished, tap `OK` again and your device will restart

unc0ver should now be uninstalled, leaving you safe to install any other jailbreak.
