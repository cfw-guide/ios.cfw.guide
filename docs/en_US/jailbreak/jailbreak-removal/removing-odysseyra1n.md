When you uninstall Odysseyra1n, you need to go and restore parts of the OS to how they were before your device was jailbroken.

This guide is useful for people who want to install regular checkra1n or unc0ver, as it requires that Odysseyra1n is removed first, or just people who want to unjailbreak their device.

::: tip

If you're proceeding to installing either Chimera, Odyssey, or Taurine, you do not need to follow this guide, for Chimera/Odyssey/Taurine and Odysseyra1n are intercompatible with each other, and can both be used at the same time.

:::

## Uninstalling

1. Jailbreak
1. Open the checkra1n loader application on your device
1. Tap `Restore System`
    - If you get `Restore Error: General`, reboot and try these steps again

Odysseyra1n should now be uninstalled, leaving you safe to install any other jailbreak.
