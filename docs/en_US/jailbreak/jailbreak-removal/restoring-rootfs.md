Uninstalling a jailbreak isn't as simple as deleting the app or stuff similar to that nature. When you uninstall a jailbreak, you need to go and restore parts of the OS to how they were before your device was jailbroken.

Depending on the jailbreak you are using, you will need to go through different steps to be able to remove your jailbreak.
