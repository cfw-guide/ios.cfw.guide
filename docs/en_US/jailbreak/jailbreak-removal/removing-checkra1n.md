When you uninstall checkra1n, you need to go and restore parts of the OS to how they were before your device was jailbroken.

This guide is useful for people who want to install Odysseyra1n, unc0ver, Chimera, Odyssey, or Taurine, as it requires that checkra1n is removed first, or just people who want to unjailbreak their device.

## Uninstalling

1. Jailbreak
1. Open the checkra1n loader application on your device
1. Tap `Restore System`
    - If you get `Restore Error: General`, reboot and try these steps again

checkra1n should now be uninstalled, leaving you safe to install any other jailbreak.
