Uninstalling a jailbreak isn't as simple as deleting the app. When you uninstall Chimera, you need to go in the app and restore parts of the OS to how they were before your device was jailbroken.

This guide is useful for people who want to install regular checkra1n or unc0ver, as it requires that Chimera is removed first, or just people who want to unjailbreak their device.

::: tip

If you're proceeding to installing Odysseyra1n, you do not need to follow this guide unless you installed Chimera before December 2020, for Chimera (if installed on or after December 2020) and Odysseyra1n are intercompatible with each other, and can both be used at the same time.

:::

## Uninstalling

1. Open the Chimera application
1. Enable `Restore RootFS`
1. Press `Jailbreak`
    - This may take some time
    - If it fails, try again from the beginning
1. When finished, tap `OK` and your device will restart

Chimera should now be uninstalled, leaving you safe to install any other jailbreak.
