Absinthe is capable of jailbreaking every iOS device on firmware versions 5.0.1 and 5.1.1, as well as the iPhone 4S on firmware version 5.0.

Absinthe is an <router-link to="/types-of-jailbreak/#untethered-jailbreaks">untethered</router-link> jailbreak meaning that it survives a reboot and can cause a permanent bootloop if something goes wrong. If you encounter a bootloop, restore your device via iTunes, Finder (macOS Catalina and newer) or FutureRestore

## Downloads

- Computer running macOS 10.12.x or older or Windows XP to Windows 8.1 with iTunes installed. Wine will not work.
- The latest version of [Absinthe](https://web.archive.org/web/20131024115207/http://greenpois0n.com/downloads/)
