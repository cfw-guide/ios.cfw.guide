TotallyNotSpyware is capable of jailbreaking every 64-bit iOS device on firmware version 10.0 up to 10.3.3.

Note that the TotallyNotSpyware jailbreak is not “persistent” (meaning it does not remain installed after a reboot). You will need to re-run the exploit after every reboot. You will be instructed on how to do this.

::: warning

Should you run into issues with this method for any reason, you can attempt to use <router-link to="/installing-doubleh3lix-(ipa)">doubleh3lix</router-link> if you are on an A7-A9(X) device or <router-link to="/installing-meridian-(ipa)">Meridian</router-link> if you are on an A10(X) device.

## Running TotallyNotSpyware

1. Open Safari on your iOS device
1. Go to the [https://totally-not.spyware.lol/](https://totally-not.spyware.lol/) website
1. Slide, left to right, on the `Slide for Spyware` slider
1. Once you see the `Spyware announcement` prompt, press `noot noot`
   - If the device reboots without prompting this, try again.
1. You'll recieve a prompt asking you to choose between jailbreaking with Meridian or jailbreaking with doubleH3lix, what option you should select depends on your device
   - If your device is an A7-A9(X) device, you *should* select doubleh3lix.
   - If your device is an A10(X) device, the only option which works is to select Meridian.
1. After selecting what you wish to jailbreak with, press `OK`

TotallyNotSpyware will now install the temporary jailbreak on your device. 

To rejailbreak in the future, doing steps 1 through 4 should rejailbreak your device.

::: tip

Tap `Share` -> `Add to home screen` for easier access to TotallyNotSpyware.

You should now be jailbroken with Cydia installed on your home screen. You can use Cydia to install <router-link to="/faq/#what-are-tweaks">tweaks</router-link>, themes and more.

If you wish to use a more modern package manager, continue to <router-link to="/installing-zebra">Installing Zebra</router-link>
