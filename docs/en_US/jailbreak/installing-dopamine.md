Dopamine is a <router-link to="/types-of-jailbreak/#semi-untethered-jailbreaks">semi-untethered jailbreak</router-link>, meaning it requires an app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot.

::: warning

As this jailbreak is fundamentally different from how most other jailbreaks have been in the past, you will run into issues with tweak compatibility.

:::

::: warning

Dopamine only supports A12 and newer devices on iOS 15.0 to 15.4.1

## Downloads

The latest version of [Dopamine](https://ellekit.space/dopamine)
  - Make sure to download the `.tipa` file onto your iOS device

## Installing TrollHelper

1. Open Safari
1. Go to [https://api.jailbreaks.app/troll64e](https://api.jailbreaks.app/troll64e)
1. Tap `Install`

An app named `GTA Car Tracker` will now install to your iOS device, this app is TrollHelper, however.

## Installing TrollStore

1. Open the `GTA Car Tracker` app
1. Tap `Install TrollStore`

The TrollStore application will now install to your iOS device.

## Preparing TrollStore

In order to be able to sideload Dopamine, a couple more steps need to be done.

### Installing Persistence Helper

1. Reopen the `GTA Car Tracker` app
1. Press `Register Persistence Helper`

The `GTA Car Tracker` app can now be used as the Persistence Helper

::: tip

The reason the persistence helper is highly important is that, whenever iOS rebuilds its icon cache, all apps installed by TrollStore (as well as TrollStore itself) will either disappear or no longer open.

To workaround this, the Persistence Helper (which will still open even after this happens) can refresh app registrations so that the apps will reappear and open again.

## Installing Dopamine

1. Go back to the `Apps` tab
1. Press the `+` on the top right
1. Go to where you saved the Dopamine `.tipa` file
1. Tap on the Dopamine `.tipa` file
1. Tap `Install`

The Dopamine app will now be installed onto your device.

## Running Dopamine

1. Reboot your phone
    - This is not necessary but recommended
1. Open the Dopamine application from your home screen immediately afterwards
1. Tap "Jailbreak"

::: tip

If the app or your device crashes/restarts unexpectedly and the jailbreak isn't installed, simply try rebooting and running the exploit again until it does work.

:::

Sileo should now be installed on your home screen. You can use Sileo to install <router-link to="/faq/#what-are-tweaks">tweaks</router-link>, themes and more.

While you are now jailbroken at this point, we need to both update and install some packages so that we're able to both update other packages and have stuff work properly

## Installing necessary software

1. Open the Sileo app
1. Tap on the "Sources" tab
1. Tap on the "ElleKit" repository, then tap on "All Categories"
1. Tap "Get"
1. Tap the "Queued" bar at the bottom of the page
1. Tap "Confirm"
1. Once finished, tap `Restart SpringBoard Later`
1. Go to the "Search" tab
1. Search for `PreferenceLoader`
1. Tap on `PreferenceLoader`
1. Tap on "Get"
1. Tap the "Queued" bar at the bottom of the page
1. Tap "Confirm"
1. Once finished, tap `Restart SpringBoard`

::: tip

After doing all the above steps, you may need to reboot and rejailbreak in order for tweak injection to function properly.
