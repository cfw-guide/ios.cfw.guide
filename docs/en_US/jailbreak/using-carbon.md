Carbon is a WebKit-based jailbreak capable of jailbreaking every 32-bit iOS device on firmware versions 8.0 to 9.3.6.

Note that the Carbon jailbreak is only untethered on firmware versions 8.0 to 9.3.4. If you're on firmware versions 9.3.5 or 9.3.6, you will need to re-run the exploit after every reboot. You will be instructed on how to do this.

## Running Carbon

1. Open Safari on your iOS device
1. Go to [http://carbon.sep.lol](http://carbon.sep.lol) website
1. Press "Run"
   - If the device reboots or the page refreshes, and you don't end up in a jailbroken state, try again.

Carbon will now jailbreak your device. 

To rejailbreak in the future, repeat these steps again.

::: tip

Tap `Share` -> `Add to home screen` for easier access to Carbon.

:::

You should now be jailbroken with Cydia installed on your home screen. You can use Cydia to install <router-link to="/faq/#what-are-tweaks">tweaks</router-link>, themes and more.

::: tip

If you wish to use a more modern package manager, and are on iOS 9, continue to <router-link to="/installing-zebra">Installing Zebra</router-link>
