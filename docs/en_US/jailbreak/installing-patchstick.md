Patchstick is capable of untether jailbreaking the Apple TV 1 on Apple TV Software 1.0 to 3.0.2.

Patchstick is an <router-link to="/types-of-jailbreak/#untethered-jailbreaks">untethered</router-link> jailbreak meaning that it survives a reboot and can cause a permanent bootloop if something goes wrong. If you encounter a bootloop, restore your device via iTunes or Finder (macOS Catalina and newer).

THIS IS IN PROGRESS PLEASE DO NOT MERGE
