LiberTV is a <router-link to="/types-of-jailbreak/#semi-untethered-jailbreaks">semi-untethered jailbreak</router-link>, meaning it requires an app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot.

LiberTV is capable of jailbreaking all devices on tvOS 10.0 to 10.1 and 11.0 to 11.1.

Due to how semi-untethered jailbreaks work, the app will need to be <router-link to="/resigning-apps">re-signed</router-link> once every 7 days.

We will use Sideloadly to install the LiberTV jailbreak application to your Apple TV for use in the next step.

## Downloads

- The latest release of [LiberTV](http://newosxbook.com/libertv/libertv.ipa)
- The latest version of [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/)
- The latest version of [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/win32) if on Windows

## Installing the application

::: warning

As the Apple TV 4K does not have a USB-C port, you will need to instead navigate to Settings > Remote Apps & Devices > Remote Devices on your Apple TV, rather than plugging it in.

:::

1. Open Sideloadly
1. Plug your Apple TV into your computer
    - Make sure your computer is trusted and allowed to view the contents of your device
1. Drag and drop the LiberTV `.ipa` file into Sideloadly
1. Enter in your Apple ID
1. Enter in your password
    - Sideloadly must make a request to its servers in order to work with free developer accounts. If you are not OK with this, you may use an alternate Apple ID.

The app will now install to your Apple TV. Once that's done, the LiberTV application can now be opened from home screen.


## Running LiberTV

1. Reboot your Apple TV
1. Open the LiberTV application from your home screen
1. Click "Jailbreak"

You should now be jailbroken with nito.tv installed on your home screen. You can use nito.tv to install <router-link to="/faq/#what-are-tweaks">tweaks</router-link>, themes and more.
