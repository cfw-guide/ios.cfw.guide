<p><router-link to="/faq/#what-are-tweaks">Tweaks</router-link> are small modifications to change the look and/or feel of your device. You can find tweaks on repositories, colloquially referred to as "repos".</p>

<p><router-link to="/faq/#what-s-a-repo">Repositories</router-link> are essentially databases that contain lots of tweaks for you to install. When you add repos to nitoTV, you will be able to install the tweaks on it, and look for them using the search function.</p>

Keeping in mind, most iOS repositories DO NOT work with tvOS!

This guide will show you how you can install and uninstall tweaks, and add different repos.
