Electra is a <router-link to="/types-of-jailbreak/#semi-untethered-jailbreaks">semi-untethered jailbreak</router-link>, meaning it requires an app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot.

The tool is compatible with jailbreaking devices on iOS versions from 11.0 to 11.4.1.

Due to how semi-untethered jailbreaks work, the app will need to be <router-link to="/resigning-apps">re-signed</router-link> once every 7 days.

We will use Sideloadly to install the Electra application to your iOS device for use in the next step.

::: warning

If you are already jailbroken with unc0ver, make sure to properly [remove it](/removing-unc0ver) before proceeding.
