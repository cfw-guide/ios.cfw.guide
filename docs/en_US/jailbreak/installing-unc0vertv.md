unc0verTV is a <router-link to="/types-of-jailbreak/#semi-untethered-jailbreaks">semi-untethered jailbreak</router-link>, meaning it requires an app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot.

unc0verTV is capable of jailbreaking all devices on tvOS 11.0 to 13.4.5, as well as tvOS 13.4.8 beta 1.

Due to how semi-untethered jailbreaks work, the app will need to be <router-link to="/resigning-apps">re-signed</router-link> once every 7 days.

We will use Sideloadly to install the unc0verTV jailbreak application to your Apple TV for use in the next step.
