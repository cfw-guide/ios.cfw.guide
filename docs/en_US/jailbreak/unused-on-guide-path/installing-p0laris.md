p0laris is capable of jailbreaking A5(X) devices on firmware versions 9.3.5 and 9.3.6.

Note that the p0laris jailbreak is not “persistent” (meaning it does not remain installed after a reboot). You will need to re-run the exploit after every reboot. You will be instructed on how to do this.

Due to how custom applications are installed to the device, in most cases you will need to reinstall the p0laris jailbreak application to your device every 7 days from your computer.

We will use the Sideloadly tool to install the p0laris jailbreak application to your iOS device for use in the next step.
