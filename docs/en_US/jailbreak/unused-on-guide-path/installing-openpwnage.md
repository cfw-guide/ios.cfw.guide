openpwnage is capable of jailbreaking all 32bit devices on firmware versions 8.4b4 to 9.3.6.

Note that the openpwnage jailbreak is not “persistent” (meaning it does not remain installed after a reboot). You will need to re-run the exploit after every reboot. You will be instructed on how to do this.

Due to how custom applications are installed to the device, in most cases you will need to reinstall the openpwnage jailbreak application to your device every 7 days from your computer.

We will use the Sideloadly tool to install the openpwnage jailbreak application to your iOS device for use in the next step.

::: warning

If your device crashes or restarts unexpectedly and the jailbreak isn't installed, simply try running the exploit again until it does work.

You should now be jailbroken with Cydia installed on your home screen. You can use Cydia to install <router-link to="/faq/#what-are-tweaks">tweaks</router-link>, themes and more.

::: tip

If you wish to use a more modern package manager, and are on iOS 9, continue to <router-link to="/installing-zebra">Installing Zebra</router-link>
