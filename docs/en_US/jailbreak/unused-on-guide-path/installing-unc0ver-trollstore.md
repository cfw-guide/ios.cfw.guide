unc0ver is a <router-link to="/types-of-jailbreak/#semi-untethered-jailbreaks">semi-untethered jailbreak</router-link>, meaning it requires an app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot.

::: warning

In order to follow this method, you'll need a device running iOS versions 14.0 to 14.3 or 14.6 to 14.8. If you are running iOS 13.7 or earlier, follow <router-link to="/installing-unc0ver">Installing unc0ver</router-link> instead.

If you have an A12 or newer device on iOS versions 14.4 to 14.5.1, continue to <router-link to="/installing-unc0ver-fugu14">Installing unc0ver (Fugu14)</router-link> instead.

:::

While unc0ver is compatible with jailbreaking several devices on iOS/iPadOS versions from 11.0 to 14.8 (excluding iOS 12.5.6/12.5.7), this method of obtaining unc0ver requires a device running iOS versions 14.0 to 14.3 or 14.6 to 14.8.

::: warning

If you are already jailbroken with Taurine, make sure to properly <router-link to="/removing-taurine">remove Taurine</router-link> before proceeding.

::: warning

unc0ver on firmware versions 14.6 to 14.8 only supports A12 and A13 iPhones.

## Installing TrollStore

The method that needs to be followed in order to install TrollStore depends on your device, select the tab that fits your device and follow the subsequent steps.

## Running unc0ver

1. Reboot your phone
    - This is not necessary but recommended
1. Open the unc0ver application from your home screen immediately afterwards
    - If you're on iOS 14.6 to 14.8, open the u0Launcher application instead

    - If you're on iOS 14.6 to 14.8, open the u0Launcher application instead

::: tip

If the app or your device crashes/restarts unexpectedly and the jailbreak isn't installed, simply try rebooting and running the exploit again until it does work.

:::

::: warning

If you receive the error `rootFS already mounted, delete the OTA update`, read the <router-link to="/troubleshooting/#rootfs-already-mounted">Troubleshooting</router-link> page

:::

You should now be jailbroken with Cydia installed on your home screen. You can use Cydia to install <router-link to="/faq/#what-are-tweaks">tweaks</router-link>, themes and more.
