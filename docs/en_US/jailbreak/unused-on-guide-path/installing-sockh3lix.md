SockH3lix is capable of jailbreaking most 64-bit iOS devices on firmware version 10.0 up to 10.3.3.

It is also compatible with the iPhone 5 on 10.3.3 and 10.3.4. It is not compatible with A10 devices such as the iPhone 7 and iPad Pro (2nd generation).

Note that the sockH3lix jailbreak is not “persistent” (meaning it does not remain installed after a reboot). You will need to re-run the exploit after every reboot. You will be instructed on how to do this.

Due to how custom applications are installed to the device, in most cases you will need to reinstall the h3lix jailbreak application to your device every 7 days from your computer.

We will use Sideloadly to install the application to your device.

::: warning

iPhone 5's using this jailbreak may run into an issue where tweaks will not load properly. If this happens, you should try restoring your device, then jailbreaking with <router-link to="/installing-kok3shiX">Installing kok3shiX</router-link> instead.
