!!!include(./docs/en_US/jailbreak/unused-on-guide-path/checkra1n/include/semi-tethered.md)!!!

checkra1n is a tool capable of jailbreaking millions of iOS devices with the A7 to A11 SoC on firmwares 12.0 to 14.8.1. It's currently only compatible with macOS and Linux. A Windows release is planned to release in the future.

!!!include(./docs/en_US/jailbreak/unused-on-guide-path/checkra1n/include/odysseyra1n-explanation.md)!!!

On A8X and A9X devices, it is not possible to use checkra1n 0.12.4 (required for 14.5 to 14.8.1 support) without the use of a custom pongoOS and checkra1n in CLI mode.

::: tip

If you are using an A8X or A9X device running iOS 14.4.2 or earlier, you should follow <router-link to="/installing-odysseyra1n">Installing Odysseyra1n</router-link> and use checkra1n version 0.12.2 instead.

:::

::: warning

You do not need to use a special build of Odysseyn1x in order to follow this, the normal Odysseyn1x guide is linked below as a result.

:::

::: warning

If you are already jailbroken with regular checkra1n, make sure to properly <router-link to="/removing-checkra1n">remove it</router-link> before proceeding.

Please select your operating system:
- <router-link to="/installing-odysseyra1n-a8x-a9x/macos/">macOS</router-link>
- <router-link to="/installing-odysseyra1n-a8x-a9x/linux/">Linux</router-link>
- <router-link to="/using-odysseyn1x/">Windows (Odysseyn1x)</router-link>

::: danger

If you have a ChromeOS device, you can attempt to follow <router-link to="/installing-odysseyra1n-chromeos-a8x-a9x">Installing Odysseyra1n (A8X/A9X) (ChromeOS)</router-link>, however, do note that it is not recommended due to the fact that it is both more time-consuming and more prone to user error.
