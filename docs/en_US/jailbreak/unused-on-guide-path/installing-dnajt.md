Def1nit3lyN0tAJa1lbr3akTool is a <router-link to="/types-of-jailbreak/#semi-untethered-jailbreaks">semi-untethered jailbreak</router-link>, meaning it requires an app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot.

The tool is capable of jailbreaking A11 and earlier devices on iOS/iPadOS versions 16.0 to 16.6.1.

We will first use Sideloadly to sideload TrollInstallerX, then use TrollInstallerX to install TrollStore, and then install Def1nit3lyN0tAJa1lbr3akTool from there.

::: warning

if you are currently using *rootful* palera1n, you need to first <router-link to="/removing-palera1n">Remove rootful palera1n</router-link> before proceeding.

If you are using *rootless* palera1n, while you won't have to do anything, note that you **will lose your existing jailbreak setup** by following these steps.
