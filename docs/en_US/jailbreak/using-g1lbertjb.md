g1lbertJB is an [untethered jailbreak](/types-of-jailbreak/#untethered-jailbreaks), meaning it only requires the exploit to be run once, whether through a website, an app, or a computer.

The tool is compatible with jailbreaking all devices on iOS versions 5.0 to 6.1.2.

::: warning
The only downside to an untethered jailbreak is that if something goes wrong, it could result in a bootloop, requiring you to restore your device via iTunes or Finder (macOS Catalina or newer). The likelihood of this happening is *low*, but it is indeed possible.
