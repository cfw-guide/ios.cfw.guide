backr00m is a <router-link to="/types-of-jailbreak/#semi-untethered-jailbreaks">semi-untethered jailbreak</router-link>, meaning it requires an app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot.

backr00m is capable of jailbreaking all devices on tvOS 10.2.2 to 11.1.

Due to how semi-untethered jailbreaks work, the app will need to be <router-link to="/resigning-apps">re-signed</router-link> once every 7 days.

We will use Sideloadly to install the backr00m jailbreak application to your Apple TV for use in the next step.

## Downloads

- The latest release of [backr00m](https://nitosoft.com/ATV4/jb/backr00m.ipa)
- The latest version of [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/)
- The latest version of [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/win64) if on Windows.

## Installing the application

::: warning

As the Apple TV 4K does not have a USB-C port, you will need to instead navigate to Settings > Remote Apps & Devices > Remote Devices on your Apple TV, rather than plugging it in.

:::

1. Open Sideloadly
1. Plug your Apple TV into your computer
    - Make sure your computer is trusted and allowed to view the contents of your device
1. Drag and drop the backr00m `.ipa` file into Sideloadly
1. Enter in your Apple Account

The app will now install to your Apple TV. Once that's done, the backr00m application can now be opened from home screen.
