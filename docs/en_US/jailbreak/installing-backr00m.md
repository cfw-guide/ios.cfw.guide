backr00m is a <router-link to="/types-of-jailbreak/#semi-untethered-jailbreaks">semi-untethered jailbreak</router-link>, meaning it requires an app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot.

backr00m is capable of jailbreaking all devices on tvOS 10.2.2 to 11.1.

:::

Due to how semi-untethered jailbreaks work, the app will need to be <router-link to="/resigning-apps">re-signed</router-link> once every 7 days.

We will use Sideloadly to install the backr00m jailbreak application to your Apple TV for use in the next step.
