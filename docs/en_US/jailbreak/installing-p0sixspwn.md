p0sixspwn is capable of jailbreaking every iOS device on firmware version 6.1.3 up to 6.1.6

p0sixspwn is an [untethered](/types-of-jailbreak/#untethered-jailbreaks) jailbreak meaning that it survives a reboot and can cause a permanent bootloop if something goes wrong. If you encounter a bootloop, restore your device via iTunes, Finder (macOS Catalina and newer) or FutureRestore

You will need a computer running macOS 10.12 Sierra or older or Windows XP or newer. Wine will not work.
