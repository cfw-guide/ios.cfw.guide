Taurine is a <router-link to="/types-of-jailbreak/#semi-untethered-jailbreaks">semi-untethered jailbreak</router-link>, meaning it requires an app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot.

The tool is compatible with jailbreaking all devices on iOS/iPadOS versions 14.0 to 14.8.1.

::: warning

If you are already jailbroken with another jailbreak (besides Odysseyra1n), make sure to properly <router-link to="/restoring-rootfs">remove it</router-link> before proceeding.

:::

::: warning

*Reliable* M1 iPad Pro support for 1TB and 2TB M1 iPad Pro's requires an *unofficial* build of Taurine. If you are not comfortable with using an unofficial build, you can attempt to use the official release, but it will be extraordinarily unlikely that it ever succeeds.

:::

We will first install TrollStore using one of two methods (depending on your device), and then install Taurine through TrollStore.

## Installing TrollStore

The method that needs to be followed in order to install TrollStore depends on your device, select the tab that fits your device and follow the subsequent steps.

::: tip

If you already have TrollStore installed, you can skip this section.
