Meridian is capable of jailbreaking every 64-bit iOS device on firmware version 10.0 up to 10.3.3.

Note that the Meridian jailbreak is not “persistent” (meaning it does not remain installed after a reboot). You will need to re-run the exploit after every reboot. You will be instructed on how to do this.

If you are using a device with a headphone jack we strongly recommend you follow our [Installing doubleh3lix](/installing-doubleh3lix) guide for 64-bit devices instead.

## Running Meridian

1. Open Safari on your iOS device
1. Go to the [meridian.sparkes.zone](https://meridian.sparkes.zone/) website
1. Tap "Jailbreak"

Meridian will now install the temporary jailbreak on your device.

::: tip
Tap `Share` -> `Add to home screen` for easier access to Meridian.
:::

You should now be jailbroken with Cydia installed on your home screen. You can use Cydia to install [tweaks](/faq/#what-are-tweaks), themes and more.
