g1lbertJB is capable of jailbreaking all devices on iOS 5.0 to 6.1.2

g1lbertJB is an [untethered jailbreak](/types-of-jailbreak/#untethered-jailbreaks), meaning it only requires the exploit to be run once, whether through a website, an app, or a computer.

In order to use g1lbertJB, you will need a Windows computer running Windows 10 or newer, Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan or newer, or a modern Linux distro.

## Downloads
