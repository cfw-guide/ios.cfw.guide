Aquila is capable of jailbreaking all iOS devices on firmware versions 6.0 to 6.1.6.

Aquila is an [untethered jailbreak](/types-of-jailbreak/#untethered-jailbreaks), meaning it only requires the exploit to be run once, whether through a website, an app, or a computer.

In order to use Aquila, you will need a computer with Windows or macOS.

## Downloads

- The latest version of [Aquila](https://github.com/staturnzz/aquila/releases/) for your platform.
- The latest version of [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/win64) if on Windows.

## Installing Aquila

1. Run Aquila to start the jailbreaking process:
