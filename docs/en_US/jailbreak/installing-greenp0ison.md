GreenP0ison is capable of jailbreaking every iOS device except the iPhone 3G on firmware versions 4.1, 4.2.1, and 4.2.6

GreenP0ison is an <router-link to="/types-of-jailbreak/#untethered-jailbreaks">untethered</router-link> jailbreak meaning that it survives a reboot and can cause a permanent bootloop if something goes wrong. If you encounter a bootloop, restore your device via iTunes, Finder (macOS Catalina and newer) or FutureRestore
