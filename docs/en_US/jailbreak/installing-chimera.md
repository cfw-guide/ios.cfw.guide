Chimera is a <router-link to="/types-of-jailbreak/#semi-untethered-jailbreaks">semi-untethered jailbreak</router-link>, meaning it requires an app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot.

Chimera is capable of jailbreaking all devices on iOS 12.0 to 12.1.2 and A7 to A11 devices on iOS 12.0 to 12.5.7.

Due to how semi-untethered jailbreaks work, the app will need to be <router-link to="/resigning-apps">re-signed</router-link> once every 7 days.

We will use Sideloadly to install the Chimera jailbreak application to your iOS device for use in the next step.

::: warning

If you have a newer device with an A12 SoC, such as the iPhone XS, you can only use Chimera on iOS 12.0 - 12.1.2. If you are on iOS 12.1.3 to 12.4.1, you will need to follow <router-link to="/installing-unc0ver">Installing unc0ver</router-link> instead.

:::

::: warning

If you are already jailbroken with another jailbreak (besides Odysseyra1n), make sure to properly <router-link to="/restoring-rootfs">remove it</router-link> before proceeding.

## Downloads

<div class="custom-container tip" id="ifJailbreaksAppSigned"><p>
Chimera is currently signed at <a href="https://jailbreaks.app/" target="_blank">jailbreaks.app</a> for easy installation without a computer.
</p></div>

- The latest release of [Chimera](https://chimera.coolstar.org/)
    - A7 or A8(X) devices running either 12.3.x or 12.4.1 to 12.5.7 are recommended to use [Chimera patched with chimera_patch](https://jailbreaks.app/cdn/ipas/ChimeraPatch-resigned.ipa) for improved success rates. 
- The latest version of [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/)
- The latest version of [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/win64) if on Windows.

::: danger

The patched version of Chimera recommended above is an *unofficial build* of Chimera patched with staturnz's [chimera_patch](https://github.com/staturnzz/chimera_patch) to improve success rate on older devices.

The unofficial build is **completely unnecessary** on newer (A9 and later) devices. Additionally, if you're not comfortable using an unofficial build of Chimera, the normal build of Chimera will still work.
