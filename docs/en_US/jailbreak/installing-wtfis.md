wtfis is capable of jailbreaking every 64bit iOS device on firmware version 8.0 up to 8.4.1.

Unlike most modern jailbreaks, wtfis is persistent after a reboot (this is also referred to as an "[untethered](/types-of-jailbreak/#untethered-jailbreaks)" jailbreak). This means that after you reboot the device, the device will stay jailbroken and you won't have to run the exploit again.

::: warning

wtfis is currently **in beta**, if you are not comfortable with using beta software, wait until wtfis (or another jailbreak) exits beta
