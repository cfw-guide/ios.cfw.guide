JailbreakMe Saffron is capable of jailbreaking every device on 4.3.3, as well as all devices except the iPad 2 on 4.3 to 4.3.2 and the iPhone 4 (CDMA) from 4.2.6 to 4.2.8.

JailbreakMe Saffron is an untethered jailbreak meaning that it survives a reboot and can cause a permanent bootloop if something goes wrong. If you encounter a bootloop, restore your device via iTunes, Finder (macOS Catalina and newer) or FutureRestore.

## Running JailbreakMe Saffron

1. Open Safari on your iOS device
1. Go to the [jailbreakme.com/saffron/_/](https://jailbreakme.com/saffron/_/) website
1. Tap on the latest version of the pdf for your device type, iOS version, and the iOS version's build number
    - The pdf's are formatted as (without parenthesis) `(Device Type)_(iOS version)_(Build Number)-3.pdf`
    - **Example**: iPad 2 on 4.3.3 (8J2): `iPad_4.3.3_8J2-3.pdf`

You should now be jailbroken with Cydia installed on your home screen. You can use Cydia to install <router-link to="/faq/#what-are-tweaks">tweaks</router-link>, themes and more.
