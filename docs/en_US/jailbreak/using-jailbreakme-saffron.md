JailbreakMe Saffron is capable of jailbreaking every device on 4.3.3, as well as all devices except the iPad 2 on 4.3 to 4.3.2 and the iPhone 4 (CDMA) from 4.2.6 to 4.2.8.

JailbreakMe Saffron is an untethered jailbreak meaning that it survives a reboot and can cause a permanent bootloop if something goes wrong. If you encounter a bootloop, restore your device via iTunes, Finder (macOS Catalina and newer) or FutureRestore.

## Running JailbreakMe Saffron

1. Open Safari on your iOS device
1. Go to the [jailbreakme.com](https://jailbreakme.com) website
1. Tap "Install"

You should now be jailbroken with Cydia installed on your home screen. You can use Cydia to install [tweaks](/faq/#what-are-tweaks), themes and more.
