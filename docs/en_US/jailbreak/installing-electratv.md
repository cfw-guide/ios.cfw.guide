ElectraTV is a <router-link to="/types-of-jailbreak/#semi-untethered-jailbreaks">semi-untethered jailbreak</router-link>, meaning it requires an app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot.

ElectraTV is capable of jailbreaking all devices on tvOS 11.0 to 11.4.1.

Due to how semi-untethered jailbreaks work, the app will need to be <router-link to="/resigning-apps">re-signed</router-link> once every 7 days.

We will use Sideloadly to install the ElectraTV jailbreak application to your Apple TV for use in the next step.

## Downloads


- The latest release of [ElectraTV](https://coolstar.org/electra/)
- The latest version of [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/)
- The latest version of [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/win32) if on Windows

## Installing the application

1. Open Sideloadly
1. Plug your Apple TV into your computer
    - Make sure your computer is trusted and allowed to view the contents of your device
1. Drag and drop the ElectraTV `.ipa` file into Sideloadly
1. Enter in your Apple ID
1. Enter in your password
    - Sideloadly must make a request to its servers in order to work with free developer accounts. If you are not OK with this, you may use an alternate Apple ID.

The app will now install to your Apple TV. Once that's done, the ElectraTV application can now be opened from home screen.


## Running Electra

1. Reboot your Apple TV
1. Open the ElectraTV application from your home screen
1. Click "Jailbreak"
