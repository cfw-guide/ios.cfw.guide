JailbreakMe 4.0, when paired with UntetherHomeDepot, is capable of doing an untethered jailbreak on every 32-bit iOS device on firmware version 9.1 up to 9.3.4.

## Running JailbreakMe 4.0

1. Open Safari on your iOS device
1. Go to the JailbreakMe 4.0 website ([https://lukezgd.github.io/jbme4/untethered.html](https://lukezgd.github.io/jbme4/untethered.html))
1. Tap "jailbreak me!"

::: warning

If your device crashes or restarts unexpectedly and the jailbreak isn't installed, simply try running the exploit again until it does work.

:::

You should now be jailbroken with Cydia installed on your home screen. You can use Cydia to install <router-link to="/faq/#what-are-tweaks">tweaks</router-link>, themes and more.

::: tip

If you wish to use a more modern package manager, continue to <router-link to="/installing-zebra">Installing Zebra</router-link>
