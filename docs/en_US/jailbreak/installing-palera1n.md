palera1n is a work-in-progress jailbreak that is compatible with A11 (iPhone X) and earlier devices on iOS 15.0 to 18.3.2, with some caveats for A11 devices.

On A11 devices, you **must disable your passcode** and will not be able to use your passcode, or other SEP functionality, until you boot into a stock iOS state. SEP functionality includes things such as a passcode, Face ID/Touch ID, and Apple Pay. 

Additionally, if your device is an A11 device on iOS 16 and you've set a passcode before, you will need to **erase all content and settings** in order to be able to jailbreak.

::: warning

If you are using an old version of palera1n that was tethered, you'll need to <router-link to="/removing-palera1n-legacy">remove palera1n</router-link> before continuing.

:::

::: warning

If you are using Windows, you should follow <router-link to="/using-palen1x">Using palen1x</router-link> instead.

## Installing the jailbreak

Please select your operating system:

:::::: tabs

:::: tab name="macOS" :default="true"

### Installing palera1n

1. Open a terminal window
1. Run `sudo /bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://static.palera.in/scripts/install.sh)"`

### Running palera1n

::: warning

If you are using a USB-C to Lightning cable to do this process, you may run into issues entering into DFU mode

If you do have issues, get a USB-A to Lightning cable and, if necessary, also get a USB-C to USB-A adapter.

:::

::: tip

If you're using an Apple Silicon Mac and using a USB-C port to plug your cable/adapter into, you'll need to unplug and replug the device after `Checkmate!` appears in the logs.

:::

1. Run `palera1n -l`
    - Make sure your device is plugged in when entering this command
1. When ready, press `Enter` and follow the on screen instructions to enter <router-link to="/faq/#what-is-dfu-mode">DFU mode</router-link>.

::: tip

A9(X) and earlier devices have an issue where they will get stuck midway through this process in pongoOS. To work around this issue, you'll need to do the following:

1. In the terminal window, press `Control` + `C` on your keyboard
1. Rerun the command that you just ran

You'll need to do this every time you rejailbreak your device as well.

:::: tab name="Linux"

::: danger

If you are trying to use a Virtual Machine software of some sort from Windows (e.g. Virtualbox, VMWare, Windows Subsystem for Linux, etc) you will not succeed with following this guide.

:::

::: warning

Ubuntu-based Linux distributions are known to have issues successfully running palera1n.

If you are using a UBuntu-based Linux distribution and do run into issues, it's recommended to either use another Linux distribution or follow <router-link to="/using-palen1x">Using palen1x</router-link> instead.

:::

::: warning

If you are using a computer with an AMD Ryzen CPU, you will likely run into issues. If you do run into issues, you should use a Mac or a computer with an Intel CPU to follow this guide.

### Installing palera1n

If you do have issues, get a USB-A to Lightning cable and, if necessary, also get a USB-C to USB-A adapter.

:::

1. Open up a terminal window
1. Run `sudo systemctl stop usbmuxd`
1. Run `sudo usbmuxd -f -p`
1. Open up another terminal window
1. Run `sudo /bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://static.palera.in/scripts/install.sh)"`

Once the device boots up, open the palera1n loader app and tap `Sileo`. After a bit of time, you'll be prompted to set a passcode for using command line stuff, and then afterwards,`Sileo` should be on your home screen.

::: tip

To rejailbreak your device, simply rerun the command you just ran and then repeat any other applicable steps.

Alternatively, if you're on versions 15.0 to 16.6.1, you can follow <router-link to="/installing-dopamine">Installing Dopamine</router-link> to install a permanently signed semi-untethered jailbreak, which will allow you to rejailbreak your device without a computer.
