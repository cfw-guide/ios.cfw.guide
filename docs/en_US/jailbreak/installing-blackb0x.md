::: tip

Your Apple TV may boot into recovery mode after using blackb0x. This is normal, it means you didn't disconnect the USB cable in time - the Apple TV automatically boots into Recovery Mode if it is connected to a computer. Power cycle it and it will boot normally.

You should now be jailbroken with Kodi installed on your home screen. To install packages, you will need to use SSH. To gain access, run the command `ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss root@apple.tv.ip.here`. You can find the IP address in Settings.
