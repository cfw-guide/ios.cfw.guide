Pangu9 is capable of jailbreaking every iOS device on firmware version 9.0GM up to 9.0.2. 64bit devices can also be jailbroken on 9.1.

Pangu9 is an untethered jailbreak, meaning that it persists after reboot, so once it's installed you will not have to reinstall it unless you erase your device.

You will need a Mac running macOS 10.14 Mojave or earlier in order to use pangu9.
