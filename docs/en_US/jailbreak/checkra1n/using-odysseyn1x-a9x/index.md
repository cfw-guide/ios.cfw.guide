::: warning
If you are using a computer with an AMD Ryzen CPU, you will likely run into issues. If you do run into issues, you should use a Mac or a computer with an Intel CPU to follow this guide.

Odysseyn1x is a live bootable Linux environment that allows you to quickly run checkra1n on a compatible device. checkra1n is capable of jailbreaking millions of iOS devices with A7 to A11 SoC's on firmwares 12.0 to 14.8.1.

::: tip
If you are using an A9X device running iOS 14.4.2 or earlier, you should follow [Installing Odysseyra1n](installing-odysseyra1n) and use checkra1n version 0.12.2 instead.
:::

On A9X devices, it is not possible to use Odysseyn1x 2.14 (required for 14.5+ support) without the use of a custom pongoOS and checkra1n in CLI mode. It is possible to use a custom version of Odysseyn1x, however, to work around this.

## Requirements

- 256MB or greater USB Drive
- The latest version of [Odysseyn1x for A9X](https://github.com/asdfugil/checkn1x_a9x_kerninfo_pongoOS/releases/tag/14.5-a9x-2)
    - For 64-bit computers, download the "AMD64" version
    - For 32-bit computers, download the "i686" version
- [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
