checkra1n is a tool capable of jailbreaking millions of iOS devices with the A7 to A11 SoC on firmwares 12.0 to 14.8.1. It's currently only compatible with macOS and Linux. A Windows release is planned to release in the future.

!!!include(./docs/en_US/jailbreak/checkra1n/include/odysseyra1n-explanation.md)!!!

On A9X devices, it is not possible to use checkra1n 0.12.4 (required for 14.5 to 14.8.1 support) without the use of a custom pongoOS and checkra1n in CLI mode.

::: tip

If you are using an A9X device running iOS 14.4.2 or earlier, you should follow <router-link to="/installing-odysseyra1n">Installing Odysseyra1n</router-link> and use checkra1n version 0.12.2 instead.

:::

::: warning

If you are already jailbroken with regular checkra1n, make sure to properly <router-link to="/removing-checkra1n">remove it</router-link> before proceeding.
