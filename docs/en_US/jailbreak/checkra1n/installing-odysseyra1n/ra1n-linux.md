::: danger

If you are trying to use a Virtual Machine software of some sort from Windows (e.g. Virtualbox, VMWare, Windows Subsystem for Linux, etc.) this guide will not work, and you should follow <router-link to="/using-odysseyn1x">Using Odysseyn1x</router-link> instead.

:::

::: warning

If you are using a computer with an AMD Ryzen CPU, you will likely run into issues. If you do run into issues, you should use a Mac or a computer with an Intel CPU to follow this guide.

:::

::: warning

If you are using a USB-C to Lightning cable to do this process, you may run into issues entering into DFU mode

If you do have issues, get a USB-A to Lightning cable and, if necessary, also get a USB-C to USB-A adapter.

:::

::: warning

A7 devices will likely fail to successfully jailbreak with checkra1n on Linux, as a result, you'll need to use an older checkra1n version and quickly unplug and replug your device once you see `Right Before Trigger`. It is highly recommended to follow <router-link to="/installing-chimera">Installing Chimera</router-link> instead. 

:::

## Downloads (Linux)

- The latest release of [checkra1n](https://checkra.in)
  - If you are on an A8X or A9X device, you should instead get the 0.12.2 release of [checkra1n](https://checkra.in/releases/0.12.2-beta#all-downloads)
  - If you are on an A7 device, you should instead get the 0.10.1 release of [checkra1n](https://checkra.in/releases/0.10.1-beta#all-downloads)

## Installing checkra1n

::: tip

checkra1n provides native support to machines running a Debian-based distro (e.g Ubuntu). It's recommended that you follow [specific instructions](https://checkra.in/linux) provided by the checkra1n team themselves.

:::

1. Run the `checkra1n` binary in the terminal using `./checkra1n`
    - You may need to run `sudo chmod a+x ./checkra1n` if the binary doesn't run
    - If you're on an A11 device, you will need to head into `Options`, then enable the `Skip A11 BPR Check` option once it runs
    - If you're on iOS 14.6 or later, you will need to head into `Options`, then enable the `Allow Untested Versions` option once it runs
    - If you're on an A8X or A9X device and are on iOS 14.4 to 14.4.2, you will need to head into `Options`, then enable the `Allow Untested Versions` option once it runs
1. Click `Start` and follow all onscreen prompts
1. You will now be presented with instructions in how to reboot your device into <router-link to="/faq/#what-is-dfu-mode">DFU mode</router-link>, click `Start` to begin
    - Follow the instructions until your device shows a black screen
1. After this, checkra1n should automatically install

Your iOS device should now reboot.

<!--Will probably make this better later on but this will work for now-->

::: tip

While you could, at this stage, install Cydia instead of continuing with the Odysseyra1n steps, we don't recommend it because of the fact that:

 - People generally tend to have more stability when using Odysseyra1n instead of installing Cydia
 - Certain ease-of-use functionality (such as shshd, which automatically saves blobs for you when jailbroken) is not available
 - Some tweaks may require or be better tested with software that Odysseyra1n utilizes, rather than the software that is used when you choose to install Cydia

:::

To install Odysseyra1n, <u>do not</u> open the checkra1n app and install Cydia. Instead, follow the following instructions to install Sileo.

## The Odysseyra1n script

::: tip

If you would prefer to do so, instead of running the script on your computer, you can run the Odysseyra1n script using the [shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8d4e206d568d4aadb624b2a6191a3771) by opening this page on your device and then clicking the shortcut hyperlink.

:::

1. Open the terminal app on your computer
1. Ensure that your computer is trusted by your device
1. Install "iproxy" by pasting and executing the following command:
    - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install libusbmuxd-tools`
    - Arch Linux: `pacman -S libusbmuxd`
1. Install the Odysseyra1n script by pasting and executing the following command: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coolstar/Odyssey-bootstrap/master/procursus-deploy-linux-macos.sh)"`
