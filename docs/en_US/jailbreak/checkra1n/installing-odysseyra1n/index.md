!!!include(./docs/en_US/jailbreak/checkra1n/include/semi-tethered.md)!!!

checkra1n is a tool capable of jailbreaking millions of iOS devices with the A7 to A11 SoC on firmwares 12.0 to 14.8.1. It's currently only compatible with macOS and Linux. A Windows release is planned to release in the future.

::: warning

If you are already jailbroken with another jailbreak (besides Chimera, Odyssey, or Taurine), make sure to properly <router-link to="/restoring-rootfs">remove it</router-link> before proceeding.

:::

On iOS 14: 
- Odysseyra1n is only fully supported on A8, A9, A10(X), and A11 devices. A8X and A9X devices are only fully supported up to 14.4.2 using an older version of checkra1n, with a special method required for A8X and A9X devices on 14.5 to 14.8.1, which is detailed at <router-link to="/installing-odysseyra1n-a8x-a9x">Installing Odysseyra1n (A8X/A9X)</router-link>.
- On iOS 14, A11 devices do not allow you to use SEP functionality in a jailbroken state. SEP functionality are things such as a passcode, Face ID/Touch ID, and Apple Pay.

Please select your operating system:
- <router-link to="/installing-odysseyra1n/macos/">macOS</router-link>
- <router-link to="/installing-odysseyra1n/linux/">Linux</router-link>
- <router-link to="/using-odysseyn1x/">Windows (Odysseyn1x)</router-link>

::: danger

If you have a ChromeOS device, you can attempt to follow <router-link to="/installing-odysseyra1n-chromeos">Installing Odysseyra1n (ChromeOS)</router-link>, however, do note that it is not recommended due to the fact that it is both more time-consuming and more prone to user error
