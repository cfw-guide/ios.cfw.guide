checkra1n is a tool capable of jailbreaking millions of iOS devices with the A7 to A11 SoC on firmwares 12.0 to 14.8.1. It's currently only compatible with macOS and Linux. A Windows release is planned to release in the future.

::: warning
If you are already jailbroken with another jailbreak (besides Chimera, Odyssey, or Taurine), make sure to properly [remove it](/restoring-rootfs) before proceeding.
:::

On iOS 14: 
- Odysseyra1n is only fully supported on A8(X), A9, A10(X), and A11 devices. A9X devices are only fully supported up to 14.4.2 using an older version of checkra1n, with a special method required for A9X devices on 14.5 to 14.8.1, which is detailed at [Installing Odysseyra1n (A9X)](/installing-odysseyra1n-a9x).
-  A11 devices do not allow you to use SEP functionality in a jailbroken state. SEP functionality are things such as a passcode, Face ID/Touch ID, and Apple Pay.
