Odysseyn1x is a live bootable Linux environment that allows you to quickly run checkra1n on a compatible device. checkra1n is capable of jailbreaking millions of iOS devices with A7 to A11 SoC's on firmwares 12.0 to 14.8.1.

!!!include(./docs/en_US/jailbreak/checkra1n/include/odysseyra1n-explanation.md)!!!

On iOS 14: 
- Odysseyra1n is only fully supported on A8(X), A9, A10(X), and A11 devices. A9X devices are only fully supported up to 14.4.2 using an older version of checkra1n, with a special method required for A9X devices on 14.5 to 14.8.1, which is detailed at [Installing Odysseyra1n (A9X)](/installing-odysseyra1n-a9x).
-  A11 devices do not allow you to use SEP functionality in a jailbroken state. SEP functionality are things such as a passcode, Face ID/Touch ID, and Apple Pay.

## Requirements

- 256MB or greater USB Drive
- The latest version of [Odysseyn1x](https://github.com/raspberryenvoie/odysseyn1x/releases)
    - If you are on an A9X device, you should instead get the v2.9 release of [Odysseyn1x](https://github.com/raspberryenvoie/odysseyn1x/releases/tag/v2.9)
    - For 64-bit computers, download the "AMD64" version
    - For 32-bit computers, download the "i686" version
- [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

1. Go into your BIOS settings and disable Secure Boot, then enter the boot picker and select your USB Drive to boot from
    - This is different for every computer
    - Search your PC or motherboard brand to find out how to get to your BIOS settings if you are unsure

## Running checkra1n

1. Once you have loaded odysseyn1x, select `checkra1n`
    - If you're on A11, you will need to head into `Options`, then enable the `Skip A11 BPR Check` option once it runs
    - If you're on iOS 14.6 or later, you will need to head into `Options`, then enable the `Allow Untested Versions` option once it runs
    - If you're on A9X and are on iOS 14.4 to 14.4.2, you will need to head into `Options`, then enable the `Allow Untested Versions` option once it runs
1. Click `Start` and follow all onscreen prompts
1. You will now be presented with instructions in how to reboot your device into [DFU mode](/faq/#what-is-dfu-mode), click `Start` to begin
    - Follow the instructions until your device reboots to a black screen
1. Once your device boots, you can quit checkra1n, but do not shut down your computer

## The Odysseyra1n script

The following steps only need to be performed once and are optional but highly recommended for a smoother experience and modern bootstrap.

1. Unlock your device
1. Ensure that your computer is trusted by your device
1. Select `Odysseyra1n` in Odysseyn1x
1. Sileo should install to your device
1. Do not close Odysseyn1x as you will need to re-jailbreak in a few minutes
