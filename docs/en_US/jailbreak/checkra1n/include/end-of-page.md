You should now be jailbroken with Sileo installed on your home screen. You can use Sileo to install <router-link to="/faq/#what-are-tweaks">tweaks</router-link>, themes, packages and more.

Before you can start installing anything else, you first need to install a few necessary programs.

## Installing packages

::: warning

At the time of writing, libhooker's latest version (1.6.9-1) has problems with checkra1n compatibility. Thus there will be more steps until they fix the issue.

:::

1. Open the newly installed Sileo application
1. Go to the "Packages" tab
1. Tap "Upgrade All" if there are any updates
    - Do not install yet
1. Go to the "Search" tab
1. Search for the "libhooker" package
1. Hold the "Get" button
1. Tap on 1.6.9
1. Tap on the "Queued" bar at the bottom of your screen
