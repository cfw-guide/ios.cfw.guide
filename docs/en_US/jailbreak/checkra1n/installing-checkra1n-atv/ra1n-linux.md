::: danger

If you are trying to use a Virtual Machine software of some sort from Windows (e.g. Virtualbox, VMWare, Windows Subsystem for Linux, etc.) this guide will not work, and you should follow <router-link to="/using-odysseyn1x">Using Odysseyn1x</router-link> instead.

:::

::: warning

If you are using a computer with an AMD Ryzen CPU, you will likely run into issues. If you do run into issues, you should use a Mac or a computer with an Intel CPU to follow this guide.

:::

::: warning

If you have an Apple TV HD and are using a USB-C to UsB-C to do this process, you may run into issues entering into DFU mode

If you do have issues, get a USB-A to USB-C cable and, if necessary, also get a USB-C to USB-A adapter.

## Requirements (Linux)

- The latest release of [checkra1n](https://checkra.in)
- An Apple TV Siri remote (any generation)
- If you have an Apple TV 4K, you will also need two cables
  - A GoldenEye, or Foxlink X892 cable
  - An Alex DCSD cable
It is recommended to purchase these from AliExpress for the best prices. Note that they typically take about a month to arrive.

## Installing checkra1n

::: tip

checkra1n provides native support to machines running a Debian-based distro (e.g Ubuntu). It's
recommended that you follow [specific instructions](https://checkra.in/linux) provided by the
checkra1n team themselves.

:::

1. Run the `checkra1n` binary in the terminal using `./checkra1n`
    - You may need to run `sudo chmod a+x ./checkra1n` if the binary doesn't run
    - If you're on tvOS 14.6 or later, you will need to head into `Options`, then enable the `Allow Untested Versions` option once it runs
1. Click `Start` and follow all onscreen prompts
1. You will now be presented with instructions in how to reboot your device into <router-link to="/faq/#what-is-dfu-mode">DFU mode</router-link>, click `Start` to begin
    - Follow the instructions until your device shows a black screen
1. After this, checkra1n should automatically install.

Your Apple TV should now reboot.

You should now be jailbroken with the checkra1n loader app installed on your home screen, which allows you to install nito.tv. You can use nito.tv to install tweaks, themes and more.
