This guide is only intended for those who are having issues with the current palera1n guide *or* would rather not use something still in beta, and will be removed once palera1n 2.0.0 is marked as stable.

If you're not having issues, it's highly recommnded to follow <router-link to="/installing-palera1n">Installing palera1n</router-link> instead.

:::

On A10(X) and A11 devices, you **must disable your passcode** and will not be able to use your passcode, or other SEP functionality, until you boot into a stock iOS state. SEP functionality includes things such as a passcode, Face ID/Touch ID, and Apple Pay. 

Additionally, if you are on iOS 16 and have ever set a passcode, you will need to **erase all content and settings** in order to be able to jailbreak.

::: danger

If you are not using the semi-tethered flag, this is a **tethered** jailbreak, which means the device must be booted using a computer every time, otherwise it won't boot at all.

However, this (and the semi-tether as well) can be easily reverted by following <router-link to="/removing-palera1n">Removing palera1n</router-link>.

If you'd like it to be semi-tethered, add the `--semi-tethered` argument to the end of the jailbreak command. Keep in mind this will use 10-15GB of storage, so this won't work on 16GB devices.

## Installing the jailbreak

Please select your operating system:

:::::: tabs

:::: tab name="macOS" :default="true"

1. Clone the repo with `git clone -b legacy --recursive --depth=1 --shallow-submodules https://github.com/palera1n/palera1n && cd palera1n`
    - If you've already cloned the repo, just run `cd palera1n`
1. Open up a terminal window and `cd` to the directory
1. Run `./palera1n.sh --tweaks <iOS version you're on> --semi-tethered`
    - Make sure your device is turned on and connected via a USB-A cable.
    - The semi-tethered flag uses 10-15GB of storage and is also incompatible with 16GB devices, **don't include --semi-tethered in the command** if you are using a 16GB device or have less than 10GB free.
    - Example: `./palera1n.sh --tweaks 15.6.1 --semi-tethered`

    - If you've already cloned the repo, just run `cd palera1n`
1. Run `sudo ./palera1n.sh --tweaks <iOS version you're on> --semi-tethered`
    - Make sure your device is turned on and connected via a USB-A cable.
    - The semi-tethered flag uses 10-15GB of storage and is also incompatible with 16GB devices, **don't include --semi-tethered in the command** if you are using a 16GB device or have less than 10GB free.
    - Example: `sudo ./palera1n.sh --tweaks 15.6.1 --semi-tethered`

Your device will then boot into a ramdisk, which will dump blobs. It will also set boot arguments and other variables, and either tether your device or setup the fake rootfs. It will also patch the kernel for you, so you can use tweaks.

1. Once back in recovery/normal mode, place the device into DFU again
1. The device will boot, open the palera1n loader app, and hit install
1. Sileo should have appeared on your homescreen

To revert the jailbreak, follow <router-link to="/removing-palera1n/">Removing palera1n</router-link>.
