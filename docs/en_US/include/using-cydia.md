<p><router-link to="/faq/#what-are-tweaks">Tweaks</router-link> are small modifications to change the look and/or feel of your device. You can find tweaks on repositories, colloquially referred to as "repos".</p>

<p><router-link to="/faq/#what-s-a-repo">Repositories</router-link> are essentially databases that contain lots of tweaks for you to install. When you add repos to Cydia, you will be able to install the tweaks on it, and look for them using the search function.</p>

This guide will show you how you can install and uninstall tweaks, and add different repos.

## Adding Repos

1. Open the Cydia application
1. Tap `Sources` on the bar at the bottom
1. Tap the `Edit` button in the top right-hand corner
1. Tap the `+` icon in the top right-hand corner
1. Enter in a repo URL (e.g. [`https://sparkdev.me/`](https://sparkdev.me/))
1. Tap `Add Source`

You can now enter the repo from this page to see all the tweaks available on it.

## Removing Repos

1. Open the Cydia application
1. Tap `Sources` on the bar at the bottom
1. Tap the `Edit` button in the top left-hand corner

The repo should now be removed from Cydia.

## Installing Tweaks
