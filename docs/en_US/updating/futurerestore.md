## Notes
If you are on iOS 15, you will need to follow [this](https://gist.github.com/nyuszika7h/aac55c97f7925cddcf5ec3167f85dfe8) guide instead. Note that if you are on iOS 15 and are on an A12+ device, you will not be able to downgrade, as there is currently no jailbreak or exploits which can be used to set nonce on A12+ devices running iOS 15.

## Requirements

- Blobs saved for the version you want to restore to
- A jailbroken device

## Downloads

- The latest release of [FutureRestore-GUI](https://github.com/CoocooFroggy/FutureRestore-GUI/releases)
- The iPSW file for your device from [ipsw.me](https://ipsw.me)
  - This should be the same iOS version as your blob
- On Windows, make sure you have [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/) installed
  - Scroll down and select the other Windows build as the Windows Store version will not work

## Getting Started

1. Open your package manager on your jailbroken iDevice
1. Add [repo.1conan.com](https://repo.1conan.com) to your sources
1. Download and install dimentio
1. Download and install NewTerm2

## Setting nonce

1. Open your blob in a text editor and search for `generator`
   ![GeneratorExample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48022799/117004373-aa0b6700-acee-11eb-8a70-c488163e349b.jpeg) 

1. Note down the value inside the `<string>` field
    - This should be a `0x` followed 16 characters which will be a combination of letters and numbers. This is your generator.

**NOTE:** If there is no generator value, try to remember which jailbreak you were using at the time of saving blobs. If you were using unc0ver, your generator is most likely `0x1111111111111111`, and if you were using Chimera/Odyssey/Taurine, your generator is most likely `0xbd34a880be0b53f3`

3. Open NewTerm 2 on your iDevice and type the following command, where `[generator]` is the value you just grabbed: `su root -c 'dimentio [generator]'`
    
1. When asked for a password, enter your root password
    - By default, this is set to `alpine`, not your phone's password.
1. Once the command executes, a lot of text should appear
1. Near the end of the text, you should see the line `Set nonce to [generator]`
 
### On Computer 
1. Connect your iDevice to your computer
1. Make sure that your computer is trusted by your device
    - Optionally, you can create a full backup of your device through iTunes or Finder
1. Open FutureRestoreGUI on your computer
    - If prompted by Windows Defender or other anti-virus software, allow the program to run - itâ€™s safe
1. When opening FutureRestoreGUI, you should be greeted by this menu:

1. Click the `Settings` button and press `Futurerestore beta`, then click the `Download FutureRestore` button to fetch the latest beta version of FutureRestore
1. Click the `Select Blob File...` button and select your blob .shsh2 file
1. Click the `Select Target iPSW File...` and select your .ipsw file
1. Then click the Next button to navigate to the Options menu, make sure `Extra Logs` is enabled
1. If you are not downgrading, then it is safe to enable `Preserve Data` in the options menu in order to keep data. However using it while downgrading may be dangerous
1. Do not enable `AP Nonce Collision` on any modern devices
1. Click Next to navigate to the controls menu
1. Click `Start Futurerestore`
