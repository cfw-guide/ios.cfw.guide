## Required Reading

While iOS firmware version 14.8 is unsigned, it's still possible to update to it from a lower firmware version and use Odysseyra1n. However, this method will **expire on December 19th, 2021**.

::: danger

Odysseyra1n only fully supports A8(X), A9, A10(X), and A11 devices on iOS 14.8.

:::

::: warning

A11 devices do not allow you to use SEP functionality in a jailbroken state with Odysseyra1n on iOS 14.8. SEP functionality are things such as a passcode, Face ID/Touch ID, and Apple Pay.

:::

::: tip

You need a pre-existing jailbreak installed to use this method.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having issues with updating, install [OTAEnabler](https://repo.cadoth.net/) and reboot. If you're still having issues continue reading below. If it worked and you're on a compatible device, move on to <router-link to="/installing-odysseyra1n">installing Odysseyra1n</router-link>.

### "iOS is up to date"

1. Remove any beta profiles installed
1. Install the OTADisabler tweak and then uninstall it
1. Restart your device
  - You can also use ldrestart or a userspace reboot

### "Unable to check for updates"

1. Restore rootFS through your jailbreak
1. Install and open the <router-link to="/installing-unc0ver">unc0ver</router-link> application
1. Turn off "Disable updates"
1. Re-jailbreak using unc0ver

### It just freezes

Re-enable the OTA daemon using the iCleaner tweak
