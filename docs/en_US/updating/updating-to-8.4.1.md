## Required Reading

Unfortunately, there is currently no jailbreak available for firmware version 5.1 on A5(X) devices. However, some devices, such as the iPad 3rd Generation, can update to 8.4.1 and use an available jailbreak instead.

This is achieved by simply updating through the Settings application normally. Because the latest available OTA version for their current firmware on these devices is 8.4.1, we can easily update to the desired firmware version, due to the age of their curremt firmware version.

If you have installed update blocking via tvOS Beta profiles, you must first remove that profile before updating. If you don't know what this means, ignore this.

## Removing Profiles

::: tip

Only follow this if you've installed an update-blocking profile in the past.

:::

1. Open the Settings application
1. Tap `General` -> `Profile`
    - This may also be called `Profile and Device Management`
1. Tap on the tvOS Beta Software Profile
1. Tap `Remove Downloaded Profile`

## Updating to 8.4.1

1. Plug your device into power and connect to the Internet with Wi-Fi
1. Tap `Settings` -> `General` -> `Software Update`
    - Ensure that the version you are updating to is 8.4.1
1. Download and install the update
