## Required Reading

If you're on firmware version 14.5 or later, you can update to 14.8.1 and use the Odysseyra1n jailbreak instead if your device is compatible.

This is achieved by simply updating through the Settings application normally. Because the latest version for these devices is 14.8.1, we can easily update to the desired firmware version.

If you have installed update blocking via tvOS Beta profiles, you must first remove that profile before updating. If you don't know what this means, ignore this.

::: danger

Odysseyra1n only fully supports A8(X), A9, A10(X), and A11 on iOS 14.8.1.

:::

::: warning

A11 devices do not allow you to use SEP functionality in a jailbroken state with Odysseyra1n on iOS 14.8.1. SEP functionality are things such as a passcode, Face ID/Touch ID, and Apple Pay.

## Removing Profiles
