## Required Reading

If you're on an unsupported firmware version, you can update to !!!include(./docs/en_US/include/latestfw)!!! and either jailbreak with palera1n or wait for an available jailbreak on iOS !!!include(./docs/en_US/include/latestfw)!!! instead. Keep in mind, you'll most likely be waiting for a jailbreak for a while if your device cannot already use palera1n.

This is achieved by simply updating through the Settings application normally. Because the latest version for these devices is !!!include(./docs/en_US/include/latestfw)!!!, we can easily update to the desired firmware version.

If you have installed update blocking via tvOS Beta profiles, you must first remove that profile before updating. If you don't know what this means, ignore this.

## Removing Profiles

::: tip

Only follow this if you've installed update blocking in the past.

:::

1. Open the Settings application
1. Tap `General` -> `Profile`
    - This may also be called `Profile and Device Management`
1. Tap on the tvOS Beta Software Profile
    - If this is not there, you can skip to the next section of the guide
1. Tap `Remove Downloaded Profile`

## Updating to !!!include(./docs/en_US/include/latestfw)!!!

1. Plug your device into power and connect to the Internet with Wi-Fi
1. Open the Settings application
1. Tap `General` -> `Software Update`
    - Ensure that the version you are updating to is !!!include(./docs/en_US/include/latestfw)!!!
1. Download and install the update
