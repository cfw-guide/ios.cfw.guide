## Required Reading

Unfortunately, there is currently no jailbreak available for firmware versions 5.0 or 5.1 to on most A5 devices. However some devices, such as the iPhone 4S, can update to 6.1.3 and use p0sixspwn instead.

This is achieved by simply updating through the Settings application normally. Because the latest available OTA version for their current firmware on these devices is 6.1.3, we can easily update to the desired firmware version, due to the age of their current firmware version.

If you have installed update blocking via tvOS Beta profiles, you must first remove that profile before updating. If you don't know what this means, ignore this.

## Removing Profiles

::: tip

Only follow this if you've installed update blocking in the past.

:::

1. Open the Settings application
1. Tap `General` -> `Profile`
    - This may also be called `Profile and Device Management`
1. Tap on the tvOS Beta Software Profile
    - If this is not there, you can skip to the next section of the guide
1. Tap `Remove Downloaded Profile`

## Updating to 6.1.3

1. Plug your device into power and connect to the Internet with Wi-Fi
1. Tap `Settings` -> `General` -> `Software Update`
    - Ensure that the version you are updating to is 6.1.3
1. Download and install the update

::: tip

If you wish, instead of using p0sixspwn, you can continue to <router-link to="/updating-to-8-4-1">Updating to 8.4.1</router-link>
