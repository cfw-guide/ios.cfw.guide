## Required Reading

Unfortunately, there is currently no jailbreak available for firmware version 8.0 to 8.3, nor a jailbreak available for firmware version 8.4.1 on 64-bit devices. However some devices, such as the iPhone 5S or iPhone 5C, can update to 10.3.3 and use an available jailbreak instead.

This is achieved by simply updating through the Settings application normally. Because the latest available OTA version for their current firmware on these devices is 10.3.3, we can easily update to the desired firmware version, due to the age of their current firmware version.

If you have installed update blocking via tvOS Beta profiles, you must first remove that profile before updating. If you don't know what this means, ignore this.

## Removing Profiles

::: tip

Only follow this if you've installed update blocking in the past.

:::

1. Open the Settings application
1. Tap `General` -> `Profile`
    - This may also be called `Profile and Device Management`
1. Tap on the tvOS Beta Software Profile
    - If this is not there, you can skip to the next section of the guide
1. Tap `Remove Downloaded Profile`

## Updating to 10.3.3

1. Plug your device into power and connect to the Internet with Wi-Fi
1. Tap `Settings` -> `General` -> `Software Update`
    - Ensure that the version you are updating to is 10.3.3
1. Download and install the update

::: tip

If you are on a 32-bit device (such as an iPhone 5C), continue to <router-link to="/installing-socket">Installing socket</router-link>.

If you are on a 64-bit device (such as an iPhone 5S) you can either continue to either <router-link to="/using-tns">Using TotallyNotSpyware</router-link> or <router-link to="/updating-to-12-5-6">Update to 12.5.6</router-link>.
