## Required Reading

Unfortunately, there is currently no jailbreak available for firmware version 8.4.1 on 64-bit devices. However devices, such as the iPhone 5S, can update to 10.3.3 and use the Meridian jailbreak instead.

This is achieved by simply updating through the Settings application normally. Because the latest available OTA version for their current firmware on these devices is 10.3.3, we can easily update to the desired firmware version, due to the age of their current firmware version.

If you have installed update blocking via tvOS Beta profiles, you must first remove that profile before updating. If you don't know what this means, ignore this.

## Removing Profiles

::: tip

Only follow this if you've installed update blocking in the past.

    - This may also be called `Profile and Device Management`
1. Tap on the tvOS Beta Software Profile
    - If this is not there, you can skip to the next section of the guide
1. Tap `Remove Downloaded Profile`
