## Required Reading

Unfortunately, there is currently no jailbreak available for firmware versions 9.0 to 9.0.2 on 32-bit devices. However devices such as the iPhone 4S, can update to 9.3.6 and use the PhÅ“nix jailbreak instead.

This is achieved by simply updating through the Settings application normally. Because the latest version for these devices is 9.3.6, we can easily update to the desired firmware version, due to the age of the devices.

If you have installed update blocking via tvOS Beta profiles, you must first remove that profile before updating. If you don't know what this means, ignore this.
