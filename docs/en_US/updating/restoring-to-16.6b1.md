## Required Reading

In many circumstances, updating to a newer version of iOS/iPadOS can make it harder to potentially jailbreak in the future.

Luckily, iOS/iPadOS 16.6's *first beta* is still signed, meaning you can restore to it from any other iOS version with the help of iTunes or Finder.

::: warning

Make sure you disable `Find My` or you'll need to enter Recovery or DFU before restoring your device.

::: warning

You should only consider doing this if you are on iOS/iPadOS 16.5.1 or later (including later 16.6 betas and iOS/iPadOS 17).

Additionally, you'll end up having an outdated beta notice appear every time you unlock your device or open/close the Control Center or Notification Center. **This is not removable without a jailbreak.**
