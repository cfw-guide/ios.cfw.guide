## Required Reading

Unfortunately, there is currently no jailbreak available for firmware versions 9.0 to 9.0.2 on 32-bit devices. However devices such as the iPhone 4S, can update to 9.3.6 and use the [Phœnix jailbreak](https://phoenixpwn.com/) instead.

As an alternative, these devices can simply downgrade their iOS:

        <tr><td>iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad 4</td></tr>
        <tr><td>iPad mini 1</td></tr>
        <tr><td>iPod touch 5</td></tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan=2>iOS 6.1.3</td>
            <td>iPhone 4S</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td>iPad 2 (except iPad2,4)</td></tr>
    </tbody>
