## Required Reading

Unfortunately, there is currently no jailbreak available for firmware version 8.4.1 on 64-bit devices. However devices, such as the iPhone 6, can update to 12.5.5 and use the Chimera jailbreak instead.

This is achieved by simply updating through the Settings application normally. Because the latest available version for these devices is 12.5.5, we can easily update to this firmware version.

If you have installed update blocking via tvOS Beta profiles, you must first remove that profile before updating. If you don't know what this means, ignore this.

## Removing Profiles

Only follow this if you have installed update blocking in the past.
