## Required Reading

Unfortunately, there is currently no jailbreak available for firmware versions 8.4.1 or 9.3.4 to 9.3.5 on 64-bit devices. However devices, such as the iPhone 5S, can update to 10.3.3 and use the Meridian jailbreak instead.

This is achieved by simply updating through the Settings application normally. Because the latest available OTA version for their current firmware on these devices is 10.3.3, we can easily update to the desired firmware version, due to the age of their curremt firmware version.

If you have installed update blocking via tvOS Beta profiles, you must first remove that profile before updating. If you don't know what this means, ignore this.

## Removing Profiles

Only follow this if you've installed update blocking in the past.
