## <a name="jailbreak" />What is “jailbreaking”?

Jailbreaking is a term used to describe the process that allows you to truly unlock the potential of your iOS device. Apple's mobile operating system is known for being extremely secure and that's partly because of how locked-down it is. Jailbreaking your device will allow you to break those restrictions and customize your device to how you like it.

Jailbreaking gives you the ability to install custom applications and "tweaks" (modifications) from a package manager to customize and enhance the user experience. Jailbreaking is free and easy on most devices on iOS 12.4 and below.

## <a name="legal" />Is jailbreaking legal?

Jailbreaking in the US is perfectly legal. In 2010, the US Copyright Office declared jailbreaking to be an exception to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. You may want to check in your country as to whether it is legal there or not before proceeding.

## <a name="package-manager" />What's a package manager?

Package managers are used to install/uninstall custom software to your device. Cydia and Sileo are both examples of package managers.

It's essentially an app store for all the tweaks and themes available for your device.

## <a name="repos" />What's a repo?

These are essentially databases that contain lots of tweaks for you to install. When you add repos to your package manager, you will be able to install the tweaks contained on it, and look for them using the search function.

## <a name="tweaks" />What are tweaks?

Tweaks are small modifications that can be installed change the look and/or feel of your device.

Unlike apps, tweaks usually don't come with an app icon, but rather instead an area in the Settings app to change how the tweak acts. Some simpler tweaks might not even have this.

## <a name="respring" />What is "respringing"?

Respringing is essentially restarting the home screen and the iOS UI. Most of the time, you can install a tweak and respring to apply it, without fully rebooting.

You won't have to reinstall an exploit after respringing, however, and you can remain jailbroken

## <a name="dfu_mode" />What is DFU mode?

DFU mode is a way you can interact with your iOS device without loading the operating system or boot loader. It stands for Direct Firmware Update. It's different from recovery mode and is generally intended for more advanced use only, however we can use it with [checkra1n](installing-checkra1n) to jailbreak your device instead.

## <a name="possibilities" />What can I do once jailbroken?

- Gain full access to your device's OS
- Get access to a package manager, such as Cydia or Sileo
- Install themes to change the look and feel of your device
- Install tweaks to change how iOS behaves

## <a name="know" />What should I know before starting?

Before following the steps of this guide, you must know the risks of jailbreaking: Every time you modify your system in any way, there is always a chance that you could lose user data and ability to jailbreak. It is, however, very rare for a system to be rendered completely unrecoverable.

- If no issues occur during installation, you will be jailbroken without any data loss
- Keep the device plugged into to a power source so that any unexpected power off will be prevented
- Jailbreaking allows you to unlock your system but can lead to data loss if you damage the OS
- You may be vulnerable to malware and other security issues after jailbreaking
- Your device warranty will become void after jailbreaking
