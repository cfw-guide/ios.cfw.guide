RedSn0w's 5.1.1 untethered exploit, known as Rocky Racoon, is capable of jailbreaking all iOS devices running iOS 5.1.1.

Unlike most modern jailbreaks, Absinthe is persistent after a reboot (this is also referred to as an "untethered" jailbreak). This means that after you reboot the device, the device will stay jailbroken and you won't have to run the exploit again.

## Running RedSn0w

1. Extract the contents of the RedSn0w zip file to any place on your main system where they can be easily accessed.
1. Run `redsn0w.exe` from the folder of the extracted contents.

## Exploiting the Device

1. Plug your device in and press the Jailbreak button.
1. Power off your device, then press Next
1. Do the following in the exact order as the program tells you to:
  + Hold the power button for three seconds.
  + While holding the power button, hold the Home Button for ten seconds.

1. Wait for the exploit to proceed.
