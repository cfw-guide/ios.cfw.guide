## Required Reading

Cydia is a package manager that has been used since the start of jailbreaking in 2008. It can be used to install tweaks and themes and is still running 11 years later.

Tweaks are small modifications to change the look and/or feel of your device.
{: .notice}

You can find tweaks on repositories. We will refer to them as "repos" from now on. These are essentially databases that contain lots of tweaks for you to install. When you add repos to Cydia, you will be able to install the tweaks on it, and look for them using the search function.

This guide will show you how you can install and uninstall tweaks, and add different repos.

This is all optional, but could be helpful if you are unfamiliar with jailbreaking.

## Adding Repos

1. Open the Cydia application
1. Tap `Sources` on the bar at the bottom
1. Tap the `Edit` button in the top right-hand corner
1. Tap the `+` icon in the top right-hand corner
1. Enter in a repo URL (e.g. `repo.nullpixel.uk`)
1. Tap `Add Source`

You can now enter the repo from this page to see all the tweaks available on it.

## Removing Repos

1. Open the Cydia application
1. Tap `Sources` on the bar at the bottom
1. Tap the `Edit` button in the top left-hand corner
1. Tap the red icon next to the repo you want to delete
1. Confirm the deletion

## Installing Tweaks

1. Open the Cydia application
1. Tap on a tweak you'd like to install
  - If you're not sure, I suggest searching `Activator` and installing that
  - If you don't like it, you can always uninstall it later
1. Tap the `Install` button at the top right-hand corner of your screen
1. Confirm the installation
  - It may take some time for the tweak to install
1. After it's finished, tap `Respring`
  - The device should appear to reboot after this
  - Sometimes, the button might not say to respring, but you can tap the button anyway

Respringing is essentially restarting the home screen and the iOS UI. Most of the time, you can install a tweak and respring to apply it, without fully rebooting.

You won't have to reinstall an exploit after respringing, however, and you can remain jailbroken.

## Uninstalling Tweaks

1. Open the Cydia application
1. Tap on a tweak you'd like to uninstall
1. Tap the `Modify` button at the top of the page
1. Tap `Remove`
1. Confirm the uninstallation
  - It may take some time for the tweak to install
1. After it's finished, tap `Respring`
  - The device should appear to reboot after this
  - Sometimes, the button might not say to respring, but you can tap the button anyway

After respringing, the tweak should now be uninstalled.
