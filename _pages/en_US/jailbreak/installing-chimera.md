Chimera is a [semi-untethered jailbreak](/types-of-jailbreak#semi-untethered-jailbreaks){:target="_blank"}, meaning it requires a app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot. Click the link to learn more.
{:.notice--info}

If you have a newer device with an A12 SoC, such as the iPhone XS, you can only use Chimera on iOS 12.0 - 12.1.2.
{: .notice--warning}

If you are already jailbroken with unc0ver, make sure to properly [remove it](removing-u0) before installing Chimera.
{:.notice--danger}

Chimera is capable of jailbreaking all devices on iOS 12.0 to 12.1.2 and A7 to A11 devices on iOS 12.0 to 12.5.3.

Due to how semi-untethered jailbreaks work, the app will need to be [re-signed](resigning-apps) once every 7 days.

We will use AltStore to install the Chimera jailbreak application to your iOS device for use in the next step.

## Downloads

Chimera is currently signed at [jailbreaks.app](https://jailbreaks.app/) for easy installation without a computer.
