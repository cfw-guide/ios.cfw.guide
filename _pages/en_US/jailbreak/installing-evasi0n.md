Evad3r's 6.0-6.1.2 untethered exploit, known as Evasi0n, is capable of jailbreaking all iOS devices running iOS 6.0-6.1.2.

Unlike most modern jailbreaks, Evasi0n is persistent after a reboot (this is also referred to as an "untethered" jailbreak). This means that after you reboot the device, the device will stay jailbroken and you won't have to run the exploit again.

## Running Evasi0n

1. Extract the contents of the Evasi0n zip file to any place on your main system where they can be easily accessed.
1. Run `Evasi0n.exe` from the folder of the extracted contents.

## Exploiting the Device

1. Remove the Passcode from your device, for it may cause issues with Evasi0n.
1. Plug your device in and press the Jailbreak button.
1. Allow Evasi0n to set everything up in order for the actual jailbreak to be preformed.
  + This will take time, your device will restart during this process.
1. Do the following in the exact order as the program tells you to:
  + Slide to Unlock the device.
  + Go through your apps until you find a Jailbreak app, open it and it should go back to the homescreen.
1. Wait for the exploit to finish. 
  + Your device will reboot, potentially more than once, during this process.

You should now be jailbroken with Cydia installed on your home screen. You can use Cydia to install [tweaks](faq#tweaks), themes and more.
