If you have a newer device, such as an iPhone XS, you will not be able to use checkra1n. Check the [Device Selection](device-selection) page to check if your device is compatible.
{: .notice--primary}

checkra1n is currently only compatible with MacOS. You are currently not running a MacOS device and checkra1n will not work on your system.

checkra1n is capable of jailbreaking nearly every iOS device on firmwares 12.3 and above. It's currently only compatible with MacOS but a Windows release is coming soon, although you can create a VM in Linux using [this guide](https://vmra1n.cumbox.best).

Note that the checkra1n jailbreak is not “persistent” (meaning it does not remain installed after a reboot). You will need to re-run the exploit after every reboot. You will be instructed on how to do this.

Support for the following devices is experimental, and may require more attempts than usual:

  - iPhone 5s
  - iPad Mini 2
  - iPad Mini 3
  - iPad Air

Every time you reboot, you must have a computer with you to re-apply the exploit. This is different to the majority of iOS exploits in the recent years where you only had to run an application to re-apply the exploit.

Once the exploit is installed, you will have the choice of installing a [package manager](faq#package-manager). For this we will be using Cydia. You may already be familiar with Cydia, as it was the default package manager for jailbreaking for 10 years.
