### Getting Generator and ApNonce (Jailbroken A12+ only)

1. If you are using Taurine on iOS 14, install libkernrw
1. Open a Terminal app and run `sudo dimentio > dimentio.txt`
    - Alternatively, you can get your Generator and ApNonce from the Generator tab in TSS Saver App
1. Go to /var/mobile in Filza and open dimentio.txt
1. Copy the 0x number after `Current nonce is` at the bottom of the text file as well as the number that comes after `entangled nonce:`. The 0x number is your Generator, and the entangled nonce number is your ApNonce. Keep these safe somewhere, you'll need them later
